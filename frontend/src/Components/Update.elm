{-| Updates the model `route` field when the route is updated. This function
handles the cases where the user is logged in and goes to an unauth-page like
welcome or where the user isn't logged in and goes to an auth-page. You simply
need to specify `routesNotNeedingAuth`, `defaultUnauthRoute`, and
`defaultAuthRoute` in your `Routes` model. It also handles users going to
routes that don't exist (just goes `back` to the route they were on before).
